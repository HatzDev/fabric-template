# Fabric Template Mod

## Setup

For setup instructions please see the [fabric wiki page](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) that relates to the IDE that you are using.

## How is this different from the Fabric Example Mod ?

This template comes with things already set that don't come in the fabric example, such as the basic names in the resource folder to advance the work of the modders and other things. Basic APIs like ModMenu and Cloth Config are already in the template to be used too.
